## GitHub Pages Deployment

This site deploys to **https://fxacout.github.io** via GitHub Actions.

**Required setup:** In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**. Under "Build and deployment", set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**. Without this, the old branch-based content will be shown instead of the built site.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src
│   ├── assets
│   │   └── astro.svg
│   ├── components
│   │   └── Welcome.astro
│   ├── layouts
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```
